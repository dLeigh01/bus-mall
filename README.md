today's lab wasn't too difficult. I am far closer to getting the hang of grids than I was this morning, which was nowhere. A good portion of this was review from last week's project, so it wasn't a huge challenge, just a lot of writing to get everything set up.

Chart.js was surprisingly easy to work with, and the minor change I had to make for the double validation took me a little bit, but was easy to implement once I was able to get my head around the method I would need to use.
