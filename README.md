today's lab wasn't too difficult. I am far closer to getting the hang of grids than I was this morning, which was nowhere. A good portion of this was review from last week's project, so it wasn't a huge challenge, just a lot of writing to get everything set up.

Chart.js was surprisingly easy to work with, and the minor change I had to make for the double validation took me a little bit, but was easy to implement once I was able to get my head around the method I would need to use.

With the demo to refer back to, this was really easy to get up and running, but it makes a huge difference to be able to see things persisting between page loads!

I removed the placeholder logo since it wasn't being used, other than that, I didn't have any bugs or anything I particularly wanted to change... All in all I think I'm happy with this lab.
